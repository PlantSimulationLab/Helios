#Changelog

[1.0.0] - 2018-11-15

**** Initial commit ****

[1.0.1] - 2018-11-26

*Radiation Model*
- Running radiation model for only a subset of UUIDs was not working properly (not implemented correctly).
- Texture-masked patches were causing an OptiX error under certain cases. Cause was an indexing typo in rayGeneration.cu

*Visualizer*
- Visualizing texture-masked patches by primitive data was not working properly
- File needed in selfTest() function was missing (Helios_logo.jpg)

[1.0.2] - 2018-11-26

*Visualizer*
- Error corrected with adding texture-mapped triangles in buildContextGeometry() function.

[1.0.3] - 2018-12-13

*Context*
- Errors in timeseries data querying were corrected in which some date/time combinations did not work correctly. Also, if a time/date is queried that is outside the range of all the data in the timeseries, the error will be caught rather than producing a segmentation fault.

*Visualizer*
- colorPrimitivesByData() now supports primitive data types of int, uint, and double. Note: it will convert these data types to float.

*LiDAR*
- Functionality added to be able to visualize triangulated fill groups used to create the leaf reconstruction: see function addReconstructedTriangleGroupsToContext().
- Calling addLeafReconstructionToContext() now creates primitive data for each leaf called ``directFlag" which equals 1 if the leaf came from the direct reconstruction, and equal to 0 if the leaf was backfilled.
- An initial implementation of functions to deal with aerial LiDAR data has been implemented, but has not been fully tested.

[1.0.4] - 2018-12-17

*Context*
- Further errors corrected in timeseries data query due to precision issues near beginning/end of timeseries
- Errors corrected in calculating the area of primitives. Areas were not properly calculated for patches with custom (u,v) coordinates, and for primitives where a scaling transformation is applied, or when primitives were read from an xml file.

[1.0.5] - 2019-1-24

*Photosynthesis*
- Added temperature response functions to Farquhar model following Bernacchi et al. (2001)
- Error corrected in where PAR was not converted from W/m^2 to umol/m^2/s

*Energy Balance*
- Error corrected which caused a segmentation fault in the energy balance model if any primitives are deleted from the Context.

*Weber-Penn Tree*
- Default tree library updated. Currently contains nine trees: almond, apple, avocado, lemon, olive, orange, peach, pistachio, and walnut.
- Error fixed that caused tree height to vary with "Shape" parameter if "BaseSplits">0.

*Voxel Intersection*
- Error corrected that caused compilation to fail if voxel intersection plugin and lidar plugin are both used in the same build.

[1.0.6] - 2019-04-02

*Context*
- Added file core/lib/libpng/pnglibconf.h. Not having this file causes problems on some systems.
- Error fixed with Patch::getNormal() function.
- selfTest() tests added for rotate patches, and boxes.

*LiDAR*
- Aerial LiDAR scan can now have a coneangle of zero without causing problems
- Aerial LiDAR updated to use advanced method for inverting Beer's law

[1.0.7] - 2019-04-03

*Context*
- Implemented acos_safe() and asin_safe() functions to catch instances where round-off errors cause normal acos() and asin() to return NaN. The new functions were implemented with the LiDAR and solarposition plug-ins where acos() or asin() was used previously.
- Error was corrected from v1.0.6 in which voxels sizes were not properly set when using addVoxel().

[1.0.8] - 2019-05-09

*LiDAR*
- Aerial LiDAR reverted to before v1.0.6, except that acos_safe() function is still implemented. There are still apparently problems with the changes implemented in v1.0.6.

[1.0.9] - 2019-05-24

*Radiation*
- Having a radiation band name longer than about 8 characters would cause a segmentation fault. You can now have names of up to 80 characters.

*Energy Balance*
- There is now a function optionalOutputPrimitiveData() that allows you to output the calculated boundary-layer conductance and vapor pressure deficit to primitive data.

*LiDAR*
- Added new scheme for inversion of LAD from aerial LiDAR data. When vegetation in a voxel is very dense, a method is used that fits to the hit point distance PDF.
- Added aerial LiDAR self-test and sample to run the self-test.

[1.0.10] - 2019-05-30

*Context*
- Error fixed when calling addTile() with a non-zero spherical rotation.

*LiDAR*
- Certain compiler versions would cause a compiler error with the 'fmin' function, which has been corrected.

[1.0.11] - 2019-07-24

*Context*
- Error fixed with texture mapping of tiles.

*Radiation*
- Error fixed that could cause an infinite loop in certain cases where the primitive has a texture mask.

[1.0.12] - 2019-08-08

*Context*
- Adding texture-masked tiles with a transparency channel was previously excessively slow. A new implementation was added such that there is no slow-down when texturing a tile.

*Radiation*
- Error fixed that caused errors in absorbed radiation when the scence contains two different texture masks of different size.

*LiDAR*
- Stability improvements.

[1.0.13] - 2019-08-09

*Context*
- Error corrected causing incorrect rotation of tile sub-patches.
- Additional selfTest() cases added for rotated and texture-masked tiles.

[1.0.14] - 2019-09-14

*Context*
- Minor change to randu() functions for case when the minimum range and maximum range arguments are equal.
- calculateTriangleArea() function added to calculate area of a triangle given its three vertices (in global.h/global.cpp).
- Copying texture-mapped triangles is much faster (similar implementation as for patches added.
- Functions added to translate, rotate, and scale primitives or groups of primitives directly from the Context without having to get their individual pointers (see translatePrimitive(), rotatePrimitive(), scalePrimitive()).

*Radiation Model*
- Calculations for diffuse radiation in a canopy were not correct, causing the flux on leaves to be under predicted (but the flux reaching the ground was correct).
- Self-tests added based on a homogeneous "canopy" of patches and comparing against the exact Beer's law solution for collimated and diffuse radiation.

*Energy Balance Model*
- Some changes were needed based on the above changes to the radiation model.
- Functions added to disable or enable command-line output messages.

*Visualizer*
- Error corrected to function colorContextPrimitivesByData() with a UUID vector argument, which did not properly separate primitives by UUID.

[1.0.15] - 2019-10-04

*Context*
- Minor changes to standard CMakeLists.txt file to allow for custom CXX compiler flags.

*Radiation Model*
- Freeing GPU memory was previously accomplished via the finalize() function. Failing to call the finalize() function, say inside a loop, results in a GPU memory leak. This function has been removed, and now GPU memory is automatically done in the RadiationModel class destructor.
- selfTest() cases added for an enclosure (furnace) filled with a non-scattering participating medium, and infinite parallel plates filled with a purely scattering participating medium.

*Visualizer*
- Very minor change to the command-line output messages (easier to read).

*Weber Penn Tree*
- Option to set the the branch, trunk, and leaf subdivision resolutions (see functions setBranchSegmentResolution(), setTrunkSegmentResolution(), and setLeafSubdivisions()).
- Option to dynamically modify the architectural parameters for a tree in the library (see functions getTreeParameters() and setTreeParameters()).

[1.0.16] - 2019-11-07

*Context*
- Primitives with a texture can now be colored based on the R-G-B color set in the Context, but have its shape masked using the transparency channel of the texture. This is accomplished with the new Context::overrideTextureColor() function.
- Functions added to calculate bounding box (getDomainBoundingBox()) or bounding sphere (getDomainBoundingSphere()) of a subset of primitives given a vector of their UUIDs.

*Visualizer*
- Minor bug fixed that would not update colorbar ticks if buildContextGeometry() was never called.
- Performance enhancements when rendering a subset of primitives based on a UUID vector.

*Weber-Penn Tree*
- Leaf UUIDs were not properly assigned when leaves are segmented with sub-patches.

*LiDAR*
- First attempt to add several new features to aerial LiDAR data processing:
	+ Use RANSAC to determine the ground height and effective canopy height
	+ Calculate maximum canopy height
	+ Shift grid in vertical direction to line up with ground (see alignGridToGround() funciton)
	+ selfTest() case to check these calculations
- Added option to addLeafReconstructionToContext() to all for sub-patch distretization (tile) of leaves.
- If the total number of grid cells (aerial LiDAR) was larger than 2,097,120 then leaf area calculation would error out without any useful error message. A catch for this has been implemented.

[1.0.17] - 2019-11-08

*Context*
- "Swizzle" capability for vec3 removed.
- Error corrected in getDomainBoundingBox() that could cause an error if primitives are deleted from the Context.

*Weber Penn Tree*
- Re-implemented leaf sub-patch tiling to be much faster.

*LiDAR*
- Re-implemented leaf sub-patch tiling to be much faster.

[1.0.18] - 2019-11-14

*Context*
- addBox() functions added to allow for texture mapping of boxes.
- useTextureColor() function added, which can be used to reverse a previous call to overrideTextureColor().

*Radiation*
- Previously, the maximum total number of rays for a scene could not exceed ~50 billion, otherwise the radiation model would not actually launch any rays. If a ray launch exceeds 50 billion rays, the launch is now segmented into multiple launches to avoid this problem.
- There was some inconsistency between references for the "twosided flag" primitive data, where in some instances the primitive data 'twosided-flag' was referenced or 'twosided_flag' in others. It is now always 'twosided_flag'.

*Weber-Penn Tree*
- Added selfTest() function, which builds all trees in the default library.
- Option to manually seed the random number generator for reproducable trees.

*Visualizer*
- Stability improvements.

[1.1.0] - 2020-02-07

+++++ NEW PLUG-IN ++++++
- Aerial LiDAR was separated from the terrestrial LiDAR plug-in and moved to its own plug-in.

*Context*
- Error corrected in which textures became flipped about x- and y-axes.
- Voxels can now be texture-mapped.
- Error corrected in which the area of texture-mapped triangles could potentially be calculated incorrectly.

*Visualizer*
- Error corrected in which textures became flipped about x- and y-axes.
- Visualization of voxels was temporarily disabled due to an error, which has been fixed.

*LiDAR*
- Stability improvements for terrestrial LiDAR leaf reconstruction.
- Added capability to perform synthetic scans of texture-mapped patches and triangles.

*Photosynthesis*
- Optional outputs added to allow writing C_i and photosynthesis limitation state to primitive data.
- An error was corrected that resulted in no response of Vc,max to temperature variation.

*Radiation*
-Error corrected in which textures became flipped about x- and y-axes.

*Energy Balance*
- Capability added to solve unsteady energy balance equation with heat storage.

[1.1.1] - 2020-04-10

*Visualizer*
- Correction was not picked up in previous version that caused Helios watermark to be flipped.

[1.1.2] - 2020-04-14

*Radiation*
- Periodic boundary condition added. See function RadiationModel::enforcePeriodicBoundary().

*Aerial LiDAR*
- Documentation page added, but still under construction.

[1.1.3] - 2020-06-16

*Context*
- Further problems with patch texturing corrected. A lingering error was causing patches with custom (u,v) coordinates to have zero surface area. This was likely introduced in v1.1.0 in correcting a similar error with triangles.

*LiDAR*
- For full-waveform scans, leaf area calculations now use equal weighting of hit points.
- Function added to gap fill missing scan points due to "sky" hit points (see function gapfillMisses()). This function is only incorporated within the "testing" leaf area calculation function calculateLeafAreaGPU_testing().

*Aerial LiDAR*
- Aerial LiDAR sample was not compiling because of an error in the CMakeLists.txt file.

[1.1.4] - 2020-06-18

*Aerial LiDAR*
- Functions added to get the beam mean free path and numerator and denominator of the probability of interception calculated in calculateLeafAreaGPU(). See functions getCellTransmissionProbability() and getCellRbar().

[1.1.5] - 2020-08-07

+++++ NEW PLUG-IN ++++++
- Canopy Generator: Initial testing version of Canopy Generator plug-in added.

*LiDAR*
- Files were not properly copied to allow running the selfTest() function from a directory other than samples/lidar_selftest. You should now be able to run the selfTest() from any directory in which the lidar plug-in is built.
- Error corrected in which sine weighting of G(theta) in calculateLeafAreaGPU() was not performed correctly.

*Radiation*
- There was a problem with the periodic boundary condition with diffuse radiation that could cause unexpected results. This was due to rare instances when a ray would hit the periodic boundaries many times and apparently cause a stack overflow (although no error is actually thrown). This was corrected by limiting the maximum number of times a ray could hit the periodic boundary.

*Photosynthesis*
- Error corrected in FvCB photosynthesis model solution.

*Visualizer*
- Helios watermark corrected to scale properly as aspect ratio of visualizer window is changed.

*Weber-Penn Tree*
- Issue corrected in which leaves not positioned correctly with respect to parent branch.

[1.1.6] - 2020-08-19

*Context*
- Overloaded functions added to set primitive data based on a 2D or 3D vector of UUIDs (see setPrimitiveData() functions).
- If a patch is created with size of 0, an explicit error message is thrown rather than triggering an ambiguous "assert".
- Functions added to flatten a 2D or 3D vector into a 1D vector (see "flatten" function).

*Weber-Penn Tree*
- Issue with leaf rotations from v1.1.5 was not completed fixed, but appears to be working now.

*Radiation*
- If the user mistakenly sets emissivity<1 but keeps scattering iterations at 0, the model would not satisfy the second law of thermodynamics because there would be missing energy. This has been changed such that the model will default to emisssivity=1 if scattering iterations is 0.
- If the user sets emissivity<1 but keeps the default reflectivity and transmissivity for the band, it is now automatically assumed that reflectivity=1-emissivity and transmissivity=0.

*Visualizer*
- Issue fixed in which there could be white "speckles" on the edges of texture-mappped primitives with transparency.

*Canopy Generator*
- Function added to get UUIDs for ground primitives.
- Error in grapevine geometries corrected that caused the radius of the end of each shoot to be very large.
- Default shoot radius changed for grapevine plants.

[1.1.7] - 2020-08-24

*Context*
- Functions added to crop the domain based on some axis-aligned bounding box. This is especially helpful when using periodic boundaries with the radiation model to delete any primitives that may accidentally lie beyond the ground surface.

*Canopy Generator*
- canopygenerator_selftest case added to 'samples' directory, and is now included in the run_samples.sh script.
- Added variable for grapevine canopies to change the color of the grapes.
- Corrected error in getBranchUUIDs(), getLeafUUIDs(), and getFruitUUIDs(), which could incorrectly throw an error if a trunk does not exist.
- If primitives created by CanopyGenerator are deleted from the context, their UUIDs will now not be returned by getTrunkUUIDs(), getBranchUUIDs(), getLeafUUIDs(), getFruitUUIDs(), and getAllUUIDs() functions.

*Energy Balance Model*
- Documentation added for unsteady energy balance model.
- Input primitive data for unsteady energy balance model changed. Users now specify the object heat capacity instead of the object heat capacity.

[1.2.0] - 2020-09-11

+++++ NEW FEATURE ++++++
- Compound Objects: Functionality to group primitives into compound object has been added (tiles, spheres, tubes, boxes, disks). When a compound object is added, information about the object as a whole is retained, rather than just adding each primitive separately. For example, when a tile object is added (see Context::addTileObject() function), the original dimension of the tile and subdivision resolution can be later queried. The current implementation is an initial draft with further development needed. It is not yet documented in the User's Guide.

+++++ PLUG-IN RELEASE ++++++
- Canopy Generator: The Canopy Generator plug-in has been tested by several users, and appears to be relatively stable. The base functionality has been implemented, and documentation is relatively thorough.

*Context*
- Function added to add a "default" patch to the Context (see Context::addPatch( void ))
- Function added to clear the primitive data for a given primitive (see Primitive::clearPrimitiveData() and Context::clearPrimitiveData()).
- Error corrected in which Triangle::getVertices() returned a 4-element vector, with the last element equal to (0,0,0).
- deletePrimitive() function now clears primitive data for the primitive(s) to free up the memory.
- Copying a primitive now also copies the primitive data for that primitive.

*Energy Balance*
- Error in selfTest() causing failure of Case #5 (actual source code was fine).

*Canopy Generator*
- samples/canopygenerator_selftest had not been added to git control, and thus was missing in the repository.
- Added capability to change fruit color.
- Added capability to change the number of triangles used to make fruit spheres.

*Radiation*
- CMakeLists.txt modified to be more robust - it was possible if there was an erroneous file in the src/ directory with a .cu extension, CMake would try to build it and fail.

*Visualizer*
- Upgraded GLEW library to v2.2.0
- Upgraded GLFW library to v3.3.2
- Fixed issue in which writing an image to file (printWindow()) would render a blank image.

[1.2.1] - 2020-11-18

*Context*
- addTile() function will automatically delete sub-patches with zero solid area due to transparency mask.
- An error was corrected in the getVertices() function for a Tile object.

*Canopy Generator*
- Fixed issue in which seeding the random generator still resulted in inconsistent random generaton of the grape clusters.
- Fixed issue with "Split" vineyard canopy that resulted in odd behavior if the canopy was rotated.

*Visualizer*
- The size/with of pixels is now actually set when passed as an argument to addPoint(). However, one limitation is that the size of points is constant within a scene and set based on the last value passed to addPoint(). Hopefully a future release will allow for variable point size within a scene.

*Energy Balance*
- There was a discrepancy between the documentation and source code behavior for setting the storage heat flux, which has been made consistent.

*LiDAR*
- Fixed an error that could cause out of bounds indexing if primitives have been deleted from the Context.

*Aerial LiDAR*
- Fixed an error that could cause out of bounds indexing if primitives have been deleted from the Context.

[1.2.2] - 2020-11-25

*Canopy Generator*
- An initial tomato model was added to the canopy generator in v1.2.1, but the file src/tomato.cpp was not added to the git repository, which will cause an error while building the canopy generator.

[1.2.3] - 2020-12-02

*Context*
- Function was added to get the normal vector (getNormal()) of a compound tile object.

*Canopy Generator*
- The canopy generator now uses compound tile objects for leaves.
- Leaves are now created by copying a prototype element, which greatly improves efficiency when building in the case that leaves are transparency masked.
- There was an error in the spherical crowns canopy causing the leaf angle distribution to be non-spherical.
- There was an error in the "split" vineyard canopy in which the UUIDs for cross-arms were not being stored.

*Weber Penn Tree*
- Leaves are now represented by compound tile objects.

[1.2.4] - 2020-12-10

*Context*
- Error handling has been improved. Errors in the Context no longer call "exit(EXIT_FAILURE)", but rather call "throw(1)". This allows for catching of errors in a debugger to provide a stack trace and line numbers for the errors. Future releases will throw more specific and informative error codes, but for now "1" is always thrown.

*Visualizer*
- An error was corrected related to window sizing on a Mac, which could result in a segmentation faullt.

[1.2.5] - 2021-01-20

*Context*
- Updating to latest LLMV compiler on Mac now causes build of ZLIB to fail due to the 'LSEEK' function. Adding the header "#include <unistd.h>" to the file gzguts.h solved this problem.
- On Mac, ZLIB was giving a compiler warning related to shifting a negative signed value. This was corrected by changing line 1507 of inflate.c to -(1L<<16)

*Visualizer*
- setColorbarFontsize() function was not properly setting the font size.
- The problem with the image only filling 1/4 of the window on Mac Retina displays has finally been fixed!
- New way of throwing errors for improved debugging was added to Visualizer.

*Canopy Generator*
- The user can now set the leaf angle distribution for homogeneous and spherical crowns canopies.
- There was an error in the homogeneous and spherical crowns canopies where the specified leaf area index or leaf area density would not be correct if leaves had a transparency mask.

*Radiation*
- Function created to add sun sphere radiation source with default sun direction (see addSunSphereRadiationSource( void ) ).

[1.2.6] - 2021-03-02

*Context*
- Improvements made to writeOBJ() function for cases with multiple materials (acknowledgement to Clark Zha)
- Capability to set/get compound object data. This allows data to be associated with a given compound object, similar to how primitive data is associated with a given primitive.
- Added selfTest() routines for testing compound object data functions.

*Solar Position Model*
- Functions were added to calculate just the PAR or NIR component of incoming solar radiation (see getSolarFluxPAR() and getSolarFluxNIR()).

*Visualizer*
- The default camera view calculation was improved to make a better guess of where to put the camera.
- An error was corrected that would cause the camera settings to be overwritten if buildContextGeometry() was called after setCameraPosition().

*Canopy Generator*
- Added initial draft of strawberry model and documentation.

*Radiation, LiDAR, AerialLiDAR, Energy Balance, Voxel Intersection*
- Architecture-specific CUDA compiler flags were removed from CMakeLists.txt file, which could cause build failure depending on architecture.
- Upgraded OptiX to version 5.1.0.

*LiDAR*
- Overloaded version of loadXML() function added that can allow for loading details of the grid only.

[1.2.7] - 2021-04-09

+++++ PLUG-IN RELEASE ++++++
- Boundary-Layer Conductance Model: The Boundary-Layer Conductance plug-in provides several models to calculate the primitive boundary-layer conductance. Currently, 4 models are available, and more will be added periodically.
- Added selftest in samples directory.
- Added selftest to utilities/run_samples.sh script.

*Context*
- Issues corrected with transformations and compound objects, where things like the whole-object size, nodes, etc. were not being transformed.
- Functions added to get the whole-object center position of compound objects Tiles, Spheres, Boxes, and Disks.

*Energy Balance*
- Minor modification to avoid getting wind speed or object length if boundary-layer conductance is specified through primitive data.

[1.2.8] - 2021-04-26

*Context*
- Added texture mapping for spheres and sphere compound objects.
- Added "Cone" compound object and self-test.

[1.2.9] - 2021-06-17

*Context*
- Fix to cone objects to use more stable acos_safe() function.
- Error corrected with Tube Objects that caused translation to be applied twice.
- The warning was removed when calling Primitive::setColor() or Primitive::overrideTextureColor() for primitives part of an object. This was removed because a warning would be issued whenever changing the color or texture override from an object.

*Radiation*
- An error was fixed that would apparently cause rays to intersect the primitive from which they were launched in some instances.
- There seemed to be a problem when rays would intersect the periodic boundaries 10 or more times, which would cause a large amount of energy to accumulate in the first primitive added to the Context. This may have been associated with an inherent recursion depth limit in OptiX. The maxumum ray recursion depth was limited to 9, which appeared to fix the problem.

*Energy Balance*
- A variable associated with the net radiation was not explicitly initiallized to 0, which could cause anomalous behavior.

*Weber-Penn Tree*
- Checks were added to throw an error if UUIDs are requested for a tree ID that does not exist.

*Visualizer*
- addCoordinateAxes() function was added to label coordinate axes (credit to Eric Kent).
- Added capability to disable messaged to the command line (see disableMessages(), enableMessages())
- Added capability to color context primitives based on compound object data (see colorContextPrimitivesByObjectData())

*Canopy Generator*
- Functions added to get UUIDs for all primitives of a given type (see getLeafUUIDs(), getTrunkUUIDs(), getBranchUUIDs(), getFruitUUIDs()).

*Stomatal Conductance*
- There was a correction to the units of Em in the documentation, which should be mol/m^2/s.

[1.2.10] - 2021-06-21

*Visualizer*
- An error was corrected that caused shadows to not be rendered when using plotUpdate().

*Canopy Generator*
- Walnut tree model added with documentation.

*Stomatal Conductance*
- There was not actually an error with the units of Em - they were changed back as before.

[1.2.11] - 2021-06-30

*Context*
- Documentation added for Compound Objects

*Radiation*
- Radiation model adapted to more efficiently handle sub-divided patches via Tile Objects. When tile objects are used to represent sub-divided patches, there is now a dramatic reduction in the amount of GPU memory used, and ray-tracing computations are more efficient.

[1.2.12] - 2021-06-30

*Canopy Generator*
- The file walnut.cpp was not added to the repository, so it has been missing for the past two versions.

*Radiation*
- There was an error in the selfTest() function, causing the compile to fail.

[1.2.13] - 2021-07-13

*Context*
- There was an error in the vecmult function, causing incorrect values.
- There were errors with the getSize() functions for sphere, box, and disk compound objects that caused them to return incorrect values when rotation was applied.
*Credit to Eric Kent for implementing the updates below
- Order of (u,v) texture coordinates for patches changed to be consistent with documentation.
- Function added to copy all primitive data from one primitive to another (see copyPrimitiveData()).
- Changed the way solid fraction was calculated for triangles so that the order of vertices doesn't matter - otherwise solid fraction would get set to zero erroneously for some triangles because the vertices were not always specified in a counterclockwise direction.
- Function added to get the solid fraction of a texture masked triangle (see Triangle::getSolidFraction()).
- Overloaded function to crop the domain based on a subset of UUIDs (see cropDomain()).
- Operators added for to test whether vec2, vec3, and vec4 vectors are equal.

*Radiation*
- Anisotropic diffuse radiation capability was added (see setDiffuseRadiationExtinctionCoeff()).

*Voxel Intersection*
*Credit to Eric Kent for implementing these updates
- Numerous functions added to slice primitives into two sub-elements when they land on the edge of a voxel. This is useful for calculating primitive area within a voxel when the primitives intersect the walls of the voxel.

*Canopy Generator*
*Credit to Eric Kent for implementing these updates
- Option added for homogeneous canopy to change behavior related to the buffer on the edge of the domain to ensure leaves are completely inside the specified canopy volume.

[1.2.14] - 2021-07-21

*Radiation*
- Correction in the normalization of anisotropic diffuse distribution. For a horizontal, unobstructed patch, it should always give a normalized diffuse flux of 1 regardless of the value of K.

*Canopy Generator*
- The 'spherical crowns' canopy has been generalized to include ellipsoidal crowns with different principal radii.

*Visualizer*
- There is apparently an issue with the printWindow() function on Linux that causes a segmentation fault. A work-around has been implemented to remove the window "decorations", which seems to fix the problem. A new overloaded constructor has been added to allow for disabling of the window decorations. When a fix for the issue is eventually found, this constructor will likely be removed.

[1.2.15] - 2021-07-28
*Context*
- Errror in copyPrimitive() function was fixed in which the primitive parent object ID, primitive texture color override, and object transformation matrix were not copied.
- Fixed issue with tubes, cones, and voxels in which the radii/size/center may have been incorrect if a rotation was applied.

*Visualizer*
- There were some potential issues with aliasing_samples set to 0 or 1 on Linux systems that would still do multisampling. A fix for this was implemented.
- There was an error when using colorPrimitivesByObjectData() when the object data was not of type float.

*Voxel Intersection*
- Bug fixes and corrections for cases where primitives lie on corners or exactly on the edges of voxels.
- Overloaded version of approxSame() function added for vec3's.
- Two new self-tests added.

[1.2.16] - 2021-09-07

*Context*
- Header file for pugi XML library (pugixml.hpp) was moved to global.h (was previously just included in Context.cpp).
- Functions added to read and convert a value from a pugi XML node (see, e.g., XMLloadfloat, XMLloadvec3, etc.)
- string2vec4 and string2int4 functions added in global.cpp

*Canopy Generator*
- loadXML() function added to allow for setting of canopy geometry parameters from an XML file. Currently, this is only implemented for the homogeneous and VSP grapevine canopies.

*LiDAR*
- calculateSyntheticGtheta() and calculateSyntheticLeafArea() functions now outputs the synthetic G(theta) values as a vector and writes primitive data rather than writing them to file.
- Function added to add a grid programmatically rather than just reading from an XML file (see addGrid()).
- Function added to add a wireframe of the grid to the visualizer (see addGridWireframeToVisualizer())
- Rays for synthetic full-waveform beams are now sampled according to a radial Gaussian distribution, rather than uniformly across the beam diameter. This is more consistent with the radial distribution of a real LiDAR beam.
- The syntheticScan() function no longer takes an XML file as an argument, but rather the parameters of the scan are now set using the normal loadXML() function.
- Option added to synthetic scans to record "miss" points.
- calculateLeafAreaGPU_synthetic() function added to allow for more in-depth analysis of synthetic LiDAR data processing.
- Hit points can be labeled according to primitive data 'object_label'
- exportPointCloud() function was upgraded to allow more control over the format using the <ASCII_format> tag in XML file.

[1.2.17] - 2021-09-15

*Canopy Generator*

- If patches have "default" texture u,v coordinates that encompass the entire texture, the solid fraction will be looked up from the texture rather than re-calculating it.
- writeOBJ() function has been substantially re-written:
    + More efficient arrangement of materials to eliminate duplicate materials and frequent switching between materials.
    + Texture image files are all copied to a new directory and referenced in the .mtl file to make things more portable.
    + Filename function argument changed from const char* to strings.
    + 'map_d' property is only written for .png textures with transparency, otherwise this apparently causes a translucent appearance for solid textures.
- Added functions to read and write JPEG images (see readJPEG(), writeJPEG()).
- Added Primitive::setTextureUV() function.

* Context *
- Error fixed in loadXML() where patches that are members of a tile objects were added twice to the output UUID vector in some cases.
- Error fixed in loadXML() where the elevation angle of loaded tile objects was not correct.
- Error fixed in writeXML() where primitives that were members of "complete" tile objects were getting written to the XML file, which could cause the member patches to be created twice in loadXML().

- Added explicit setting of CUDA compiler optimization flag for Debug/Release build types.

* Radiation *
- Added check to addBand() function to prevent users from adding duplicate bands.
- For each ray launch 'batch', the previous batch output message will be cleared so it will not continue printing a new line for each batch launch.

* Energy Balance *
- If no object length is specified via primitive data, the model will first check to see if the primitive is a member of an object, in which case it will use the object area to calculate the characteristic length for boundary-layer conductance calculations.

- Fixed an error in Context::loadPLY() introduced in version 1.2.52 that caused PLY models to not be read correctly.

[1.2.55] 2023-01-06

*General*
- The CMakeLists.txt for tutorial1 was not updated to be consistent with all the rest.

*Context*
- All declarations related to primitive, object, and global data were moved from core/src/Context.cpp to core/src/Context_data.cpp

*Boundary-Layer Conductance*
- Minor errors corrected in documentation

[1.2.58] 2023-03-14

*Context*
- Context::copyObject() function did not copy object data. Function Context::copyObjectData() was added and is now called.

- There were cases in which objects read from file could end up with child primitives that had the wrong object ID.

*Canopy Generator*
- Changing bean model to use Polymesh objects for leaves broke the model. Reverting back to triangle primitives for now.

*Context*
- Compound objects no longer manage color in order to allow object primitives to have different colors.

*LiDAR*
- Error corrected when writing synthetic point clouds that would incorrectly add a line carriage return after a point that was un-labeled.
- Numerical precision issues corrected in synthetic scans where hit points lying exactly on the seam where two primitives meet could randomly result in a miss.
- When calling LiDARcloud::syntheticScan() with record_misses=true now generates miss points for beams that do not intersect the voxel grid.
- The 'timestamp' field for synthetic scans was revised to be globally consistent for all pulses including misses.
- The 'intensity' field for synthetic scans was revised to have a value of 0 for misses (was previously an arbitrarily large number).

[1.2.61] 2023-06-19

*Context*
- Fixed Context::writeXML( const char*, std::vector<uint> ) method, which would write out primitives that were part of compound objects regardless of whether their UUID was specified in the input vector argument.
- Added Context::writeXML_byobjects() method to write geometry to XML based on a vector of compound object IDs.
- Made temporary fix to Context::writeXML() file to correct an issue where primitives part of a Tile were not loaded correctly if the Tile is complete. The fix was to write all primitives part of an object to XML regardless of whether the object is complete.

*LiDAR*
- Added LiDARcloud::exportPointCloudPTX() method to export to the PTX file format.

*Canopy Generator*
- Fixed error caused by canopy_rotation is not equal to zero in the SplitGrapevine canopy.

*Stomatal Conductance*
- Factor converting boundary-layer conductance to heat to moisture changed from 0.97 to 1.08 to be consistent with energy balance plug-in.
- The stomatal conductance model will now check for the primitive data "boundarylayer_conductance_out" to use for the boundary-layer conductance value. If the energy balance plug-in is being used to calculate the boundary-layer conductance, this optional output primitive data should be enabled so that it can be used by other plug-ins.

*LiDAR*
- Added overloaded version of calculateLeafAreaGPU_equal_weighting() that accepts a vector of G values. A separate LAD inversion will be performed for each G value, setting G in all voxels to this value.
- Modified the overloaded version of gapfillMisses to accept an additional argument, add_flags, which adds a flag as hitpoint data (0: original point, 1: gapfilled, 2: extrapolated at downward edge, 3: extrapolated at upward edge) - added checks to catch issue when one sweep of the LiDAR had zero points - added a check so that if gapfill_grid_only is true and the range is outside of the one provided in the XML file, the XML file range will be used - printed a little more info to screen about the extrapolation ranges and the input arguments.
- Added in overloaded version of triangulateHitPoints() that applies a scalar filter before triangulating.

- The 'surface_humidity' input listed in the documentation was not actually implemented.
- A warning message is now issued if the boundary-layer conductance is calculated from the length/area of a primitive instead of an object.
- Made sure warning messages are disabled when disableMessages() is called.

* LiDAR *
- Converted to using helios_runtime_error() for error handling.
- Removed 'Nhits' field from ScanMetadata struct, as this was not used.
- LiDARcloud::syntheticScan: Changed the method of grouping rays into hit points so that it is based on detecting peaks in the histogram of intensity weighted distance, closer to what a real LiDAR scanner would do. A pulse distance threshold is then used to merge hit points that are close together.
- LiDARcloud::syntheticScan: scanner range was set to 1000 m instead of 1e6. Miss points are now assigned a value of 1001 m.
- LiDARcloud::calculateLeafAreaGPU_synthetic: removed unused components, including weighting by sine of zenith angle in transmission probability calculation

- Added error checking to LiDARcloud::export[*] methods to check whether the output file was successfully created.
- Added method LiDARcloud::exportTriangleInclinationDistribution() to easily calculate and export triangulation angle distribution.
- If users specify a scan thetaMax that is out of range and thetaMax is truncated to pi, the thetaMin value will also be set to 0.
- ScanMetadata::direction2rc() function will truncate any points outside of the specified scan range (thetaMin - thetaMax; phiMin - phiMax).

[1.3.3] 2023-10-24

*Context*
- Simpler overloaded versions of Context::loadPLY() and Context::loadOBJ() added that only require a filename argument.

*Stomatal Conductance*
- Any steady-state stomatal conductance model can now be run in dynamic mode based on stomatal time constants for opening and closing.

*Solar Position*
- Added method calibrateTurbidityFromTimeseries() to calibrate turbidity based on a timeseries of measured solar irradiance. For now, this method only uses the maximum solar flux in the dataset to calibrate the turbidity.
- Several methods were made const to have const-correctness.

[1.3.4] 2023-11-10

[1.3.5] 2023-12-13

- Some updates to documentation and README

*Context*
- There was an error in the documentation for reading .obj files. When object groups are specified in the .obj file, the object label/name is assigned to primitive data called 'object_label'. Previously, the documentation said 'object_group'.

*Radiation*
- Images written by RadiationModel::writeCameraImage() were upside-down.
- Added direct writing of label bounding boxes (see RadiationModel::writeImageBoundingBoxes).
- Method RadiationModel::writeNormCameraImage() was not working correctly. It did not actually normalize by the maximum image value.

*LiDAR*
- Triangulation could in rare cases produce triangles with a surface area of NaN, which would cause problems when calculating the area-weighted angle distribution. These triangles are now automatically removed.

[1.3.7] 2024-01-23

* Updated copyrights to 2024 *

*Context*
- Changed methods Context::setCurrentTimeseriesPoint(), Context::queryTimeseriesData(), Context::queryTimeseriesDate(), and Context::queryTimeseriesTime() to error out if the timeseries data does not exist. Previously, only a warning was issued, which caused a segmentation fault.
- Added explicit error message to geometry generation functions when the specified texture file dies not exist.

- Added overloaded version of RadiationModel::scaleSpectrum() that performs scaling in-place without creating new global data.
- Periodic boundary conditions were not working correctly with the radiation camera.
- Output radiation images were incorrectly flipped about the vertical axis.

[1.3.12] 2024-06-03

*utilities/create_project.sh script*
- syntheticannotation plug-in was missing from this script, which also caused run_samples.sh to fail to run its self-test.

*Context*
- Added Context::cleanDeletedUUIDs() to delete UUIDs from a vector when the corresponding primitive does not exist. This is useful, for example, to update UUID vectors when deleting some primitives, such as after calling cropDomain().
- Added fix for edge case in getFileExtension() to consider case where the filename starts with a '.' and had no extension.
- Performance improvements when adding geometry with textures. Existence of the texture file is now only checked when a new texture is added.

*Radiation*
- In-place version of RadiationModel::scaleSpectrum() was not actually added in the last commit.
- Added a check to make sure that the radiation camera position and 'lookat' coordinates are not the same.
- Added a check in RadiationModel::writeNormCameraImage() to throw an error if the camera data does not exist. This check was there for RadiationModel::writeCameraImage(), but was missing in RadiationModel::writeNormCameraImage() which could cause an uncaught error.
- Added support for periodic boundary conditions with depth images.
- Changed previous version of RadiationModel::writeDepthImage() to RadiationModel::writeDepthImageData() (writes ASCII files with depth image data).
- Added new RadiationModel::writeDepthImage(), which writes a JPEG version of (normalized) depth images.
- Removed previously deprecated version of RadiationModel::addRadiationCamera(). Use versions that take a CameraProperties struct instead.
- Behavior of twosided_flag = 0 was changed for direct sources. Previously, primitives could receive direct radiation from the back side when twosided_flag = 0, but now they cannot.
- twosided_flag = 2 was not implemented correctly and was not working in most cases.
- Added case for twosided_flag = 3 to make the primitive completely invisible to any radiation.
- Added ability to visualize radiation sources by adding their geometry to the Context. See RadiationModel::enableLightModelVisualization().

- Added RadiationModel::getCameraPosition(), RadiationModel::getCameraLookat(), and RadiationModel::getCameraOrientation() methods.
- Geometry for the light source model visualizations was not being correctly rotated.
- Added check to RadiationModel::setCameraSpectralResponse() to make sure band actually exists.

- Added RadiationModel::integrateSourceSpectrum() to easily integrate a source spectrum over a given wavelength range.
- Added a filter to RadiationModel::writeImageBoundingBoxes() to not write bounding boxes with a width of 0 pixels.
- Added RadiationModel::writeCameraImageData() to write out raw camera pixel flux data to ASCII text file.
- 'flux_to_pixel_conversion' argument of RadiationModel::writeCameraImage() was not implemented.
- File was not closed at the end of writing in RadiationModel::writeDepthImageData().
- Added RadiationModel::deleteRadiationSource().
- Deleted some overloaded versions of RadiationModel::addSunSphereSource() that take a sourceID as input to change the source ID. Instead we can use RadiationModel::deleteRadiationSource() and re-add a new source.
- Fixed an error in RadiationModel::getSourceFlux() for sun sphere sources that caused the flux to be incorrect.

[1.3.14] 2024-06-22

***NEW PLUG-IN***
- Plant Architecture plug-in merged from development branch to master repo. This plug-in is still in beta testing and is not yet fully documented and is likely to still have a number of bugs. Please report bugs as you find them.

*Context*
- Cone object girth was not being properly scaled.

*Solar Position*
- Added sub-model to calculate solar fluxes and diffuse fraction for cloudy conditions based on radiometer measurements (see SolarPosition::enableCloudCalibration()).
- Changed many variable names to make units more explicit.

*Radiation*
- Added "ActiveGrow_LED_RedBloom" light to light spectral library.

[1.3.15] 2024-07-01

*Added Contributing.md file to the root directory of the repository to help guide users on how to contribute to the Helios project.

*Context*
- Added checks to all primitive and object rotation functions to return immediately if a zero rotation is specified.
- Added checks to all primitive and object scaling functions to return immediately if no scaling is to be applied.
- Added checks to all primitive and object translation functions to return immediately if no translation is to be applied.
- Using JPEG textures with tiles was broken in v1.3.12.
- helios::readJPEG() was not working and would cause a segmentation fault.
- Added helios::getImageResolutionJPEG() function to query the resolution of a JPEG image without loading it.
- Changed UUID argument of Context::cropDomain() to be automatically trimmed of any UUIDs that were deleted as a result of cropping.
- vertex0, vertex1, and vertex2 data members of Triangle primitives were removed, as they are not used.
- Added Context::filterObjectsByData() methods to give object analogue to Context::filterPrimitivesByData().

*Radiation*
- Added ASTMG173 diffuse reference spectrum ("solar_spectrum_diffuse_ASTMG173") to solar_spectrum_ASTMG173.xml.
- Renamed ASTMG173 direct reference spectrum to "solar_spectrum_direct_ASTMG173" in solar_spectrum_ASTMG173.xml. This should be used instead of the old "solar_spectrum_ASTMG173".
- Setting band fluxes based on the source spectrum was not working correctly.
- Changed self-test Case #9 to have a 'sun sphere' source instead of collimated source, since sun sphere sources are never checked in the self-test.

*Plant Architecture*
- Added selfTest(). This is empty for now, but will be run to compile the plug-in when tests are run.
- Added PlantArchitecture::deletePlantInstance() to make sure everything gets cleaned up properly when deleting a plant. Just deleting the object IDs from the Context causes issues.
- Added check in PlantArchitecture::detectGroundCollision() to ignore objects that don't exist in the Context.
- Error corrected in parsing of plant string (credit to Heesup Yun for fixing this).
- Changed output tags/labels (e.g., plantID, peduncleID, etc.) to be object data instead of primitive data to decrease memory usage.

*Visualizer*
- Fixed compiler warning about truncation when calling snprintf within Visualizer::addColorbarByCenter.
