 \section PhotoDescription Introduction

 The photosynthesis plug-in implements two types of models: the biochemical model of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00386231">Farquhar, von Caemmerer, and Berry (1980)</a>, and an empirical model similar to that of <a href="../../plugins/photosynthesis/doc/Johnson_2010_PlantMod.pdf">Johnson (2010)</a>, which are described separately below.

 By default, the plug-in uses the biochemical model. The model can either be set explicitly, as illustrated in the code below, or the model type will be inferred based on the model coefficients that are set (see descriptions below).

 ~~~~~~{.cpp}
  #include "PhotosynthesisModel.h"

  int main(){
	PhotosynthesisModel photosynthesismodel(&context);

	//Use the Farquahar-von Caemmerer-Berry model
	photosynthesismodel.setModelType_Farquhar();

	photosynthesismodel.run();

	//Switch back to the empirical model
	photosynthesismodel.setModelType_Empirical();
  }

 \section FarquharDescription Farquhar, von Caemmerer, Berry Model Description

 The model of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00386231">Farquhar, von Caemmerer, and Berry (1980)</a> is a biochemical model of photosynthesis. The form used here predicts photosynthetic production as a function of photoshynthetically active radiation flux, ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and stomatal conductance, which may itself provide responses to a number of additional environmental variables.

 The implementation used here calculates the net rate of CO<sub>2</sub> exchange as

 \f[A=\left(1-\frac{\Gamma^*}{C_i}\right)\mathrm{min}\left\{W_c,W_j,W_p\right\}-R_d,\f]

 where

 \f[W_c=\frac{V_{cmax}C_i}{C_i+K_{co}}\f]

 is the rate limited by Rubisco, with

 \f[K_{co}=K_c\left(1+\frac{O}{K_O}\right),\f]

 where \f$O\f$ is oxygen concentration.

 \f[W_j=\dfrac{J C_i}{4C_i+8\Gamma^*}\f]

 is the rate limited by RuBP regeneration.

 The light response of \f$J\f$, the potential electron transport rate, can be described as a rectangular hyperbola with 1 shape parameter, or non-rectangular hyperbola with 2 shape parameters.
 The rectangular hyperbola takes the form

 \f[ J(Q) = \dfrac{J_{max} \alpha Q}{\alpha Q + J_{max}} \f]

 where \f$Q\f$ is the photosynthetically active absorbed radiation flux (\f$\mu mol\,m^{-2}\,s^{-1}\f$), \f$J_{max}\f$ is the temperature-dependent maximum potential electron transport rate (\f$\mu mol\,m^{-2}\,s^{-1}\f$), and \f$\alpha\f$ is the intrinsic quantum efficiency of electron transport (\f$electron\,photon^{-1}\f$) which defines the initial slope of the light response, determines its resulting shape in the rectangular hyperbolic form, and is thought to be relatively conserved around 0.5.
 The non-rectangular hyperbola takes the form

 \f[J(Q) = \dfrac{\alpha Q + J_{max} - \sqrt{(\alpha Q + J_{max})^2 - 4 \theta \alpha Q J_{max}}}{2 \theta}\f]

 where \f$\theta\f$ is an additional parameter (unitless) that shapes the light response curve beyond its initial slope. When \f$\theta\f$ approaches zero, the two forms become equivalent. In Photosynthesis Plugin, the rectangular form will be assumed unless \f$\theta\f$ is specified by the user.

 \f[W_p=\dfrac{3\,TPU\,C_i}{C_i-\Gamma^*}\f]

 is the rate limited by triose phosphate utilization. Note that if the TPU parameter is not set by the user, this state is ignored.

 The intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration \f$C_i\f$ is determined from the relation

 \f$A=0.75g_M\left(C_{a}-C_i\right)\f$

 which is solved numerically using the Secant method, since \f$A\f$ is a complex nonlinear function of \f$C_i\f$ which prevents an analytical solution for \f$C_i\f$. The 0.75 factor comes from the fact that diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> in air is slower than that of water vapor (see Eq. 7.33 of <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387949376#otherversion=9781461216261">Campbell and Norman</a>).

 \f$g_M\f$ is the conductance to moisture transfer between the leaf interior and just outside of the leaf boundary-layer, and is calculated as

 \f$g_M = 1.08g_Hg_S\left[\dfrac{\zeta}{1.08g_H+g_S\zeta}+\dfrac{(1-\zeta)}{1.08g_H+g_S(1-\zeta)}\right]\f$,

 where \f$g_H\f$ is the boundary-layer conductance to heat, and \f$1.08g_H\f$ gives the boundary-layer conductance to moisture considering the differences in diffusivity between water vapor and heat. \f$n_s\f$ is the number of primitive faces, which is determined by the value of primitive data "twosided_flag" (twosided\_flag=0 is single-sided and \f$n_s=1\f$, twosided\_flag=1 is two-sided and \f$n_s=2\f$).

 \f$\zeta=\dfrac{D_{upper}}{D_{lower}+D_{upper}}\f$

 is the stomatal sidedness, which is the ratio of the stomatal density of the upper leaf surface to the sum of the upper and lower leaf surface densities, which is set by the primitive data value "stomatal_sidedness". For leaves, \f$\zeta=0\f$ corresponds to hypostomatous leaves (stomata on one side), and \f$\zeta=0.5\f$ to amphistomatous leaves (stomata equally on both sides). It is important to note that if \f$n_s=1\f$, then the value of \f$\zeta\f$ will be overridden and set to 0.


\subsection FvCBtemperature Temperature response of model parameters

Two different temperature response functions are commonly used in photosynthetic modeling and supported in the Photosynthesis Plugin. One is an Arrhenius equation, which is exponentially increasing with no decline in the region of use. The other is a modified Arrhenius equation with a peak or temperature optimum, beyond which there is a decline in the value of the function, representing a denaturing of an enzyme and subsequent reduction of its activity.

 \f[
 \begin{aligned}
 k &= k_{25} \cdot \exp \left[\frac{\Delta H_a}{R} \left(\frac{1}{298}-\frac{1}{T_{leaf}} \right) \right] \frac{f(298)}{f(T_{leaf})}, \\
 f(T_{leaf}) &= 1+\exp \left[\frac{\Delta H_d}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_{opt}} - \frac{1}{T_{leaf}} \right) - \ln \left(\frac{\Delta H_d}{\Delta H_a}-1 \right) \right]
 \end{aligned}
 \f]

In this form, the model is conveniently parameterized by the commonly used standard reference rate at 25\f$^\circ\f$C, \f$k_{25}\f$, as well as the energy of activation, \f$A = \Delta H_a = dH_a\f$ of the Arrhenius equation, but also by the observable temperature optimum, \f$T_{opt}\f$ and one additional fitted parameter, the energy of deactivation, \f$D = \Delta H _d = dH_d\f$, related to the rate of decline from the optimum.

As \f$T_{opt}\f$ \f$\to \infty\f$, then the peaked form approaches the standard, unpeaked Arrhenius equation, allowing for mathematical backwards compatibility for parameters obtained from fitting to the standard unpeaked form.

In the Photosynthesis Plugin, the Arrhenius form will be assumed as it requires fewer parameters, unless the additional parameters \f$dH_d\f$ and \f$T_{opt}\f$ are specified by the user.

| Parameter | Description                            | Units                     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| \f$k_{25}\f$  | reference rate at 25\f$^\circ\f$C     | \f$\mu mol\,m^{-2}\,s^{-1}\f$ |
| \f$dH_a\f$    | activation energy (rate of increase)   | \f$kJ\,mol^{-1}\f$            |
| \f$dH_d\f$    | deactivation energy (rate of decrease) | \f$kJ\,mol^{-1}\f$            |
| \f$T_{opt}\f$ | optimum temperature in Kelvin          | \f$K\f$                       |
| \f$T_{leaf}\f$| leaf surface temperature in Kelvin     | \f$K\f$                       |
| \f$R\f$       | ideal gas constant, 0.008314           | \f$kJ\,mol^{-1}\,K^{-1}\f$    |

 Additional temperature parameters that are not typically fit to use the standard Arrhenius form with the parameters obtained by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2001.00668.x">Bernacchi et al. (2001)</a>, and are given by the following equations

 \f[
 \begin{aligned}
 \Gamma^* &= 42.60 \cdot \exp \left[ \frac{37.83}{R} \left(\frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{T_{leaf}} \right) \right] \\
 K_c &= 400.3 \cdot \exp \left[ \frac{79.43}{R} \left(\frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{T_{leaf}} \right) \right] \\
 K_o &= 275.1 \cdot \exp \left[ \frac{36.38}{R} \left(\frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{T_{leaf}} \right) \right] \\
 R_d &= R_{d,25} \cdot \exp \left[ \frac{46.39}{R} \left(\frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{T_{leaf}} \right) \right]

\subsubsection FvCBSettingPhotoParams Setting FvCB Model Parameters

The model coefficients can be set manually or by using the library of coefficients provided in the table above.

To load the FvCB parameters from the library, call the function \ref PhotosynthesisModel::setFarquharCoefficientsFromLibrary() with the species name as an argument. This will automatically set the parameters for all primitives. Alternatively, a vector of UUIDs can be passed to this function to set the parameters for a subset of primitives.

To set the parameters manually, first declare an instance of the \ref FarquharModelCoefficients structure, and then set the parameters using the member functions of the structure. Finally, call the function \ref PhotosynthesisModel::setModelCoefficients() with the structure as an argument.

Each parameter has a setter function, which is the means by which the underlying response function to be used is specified.

<u>Parameter Temperature Response</u>
1. No temperature response: Call the setter function (e.g., \ref FarquharModelCoefficients::setVcmax()) with a single argument. This will make the parameter constant with temperature.
2. Standard Arrhenius temperature response: Call the setter function (e.g., \ref FarquharModelCoefficients::setVcmax()) with two arguments - the first parameter being the value at 25<sup>o</sup>C, and the second being the \f$dH_a\f$ of the parameter temperature response.
3. Arrhenius temperature response with an optimum: Call the setter function (e.g., \ref FarquharModelCoefficients::setVcmax()) with four arguments - the first parameter being the value at 25<sup>o</sup>C, the second being the \f$dH_a\f$ of the parameter temperature response, the third being the \f$T_{opt}\f$ of the parameter temperature response, and the fourth being the \f$dH_d\f$ of the parameter temperature response.

<u>Light Response</u>
1. Rectangular hyperbola: Call the setter function \ref FarquharModelCoefficients::setQuantumEfficiency_alpha() to set only the alpha parameter. This will enable the rectangular hyperbola light response. Note also the \ref FarquharModelCoefficients::setQuantumEfficiency_alpha() function can be called with multiple arguments in order to specify a temperature response as described above.
2. Non-rectangular hyperbola: Call both setter functions \ref FarquharModelCoefficients::setQuantumEfficiency_alpha() and \ref FarquharModelCoefficients::setLightResponseCurvature_theta(). This will enable the non-rectangular hyperbola light response. Each of these can also be called with multiple arguments to specify a temperature response as described above.

Note that the parameter sets in the library vary in terms of which response functions are used based on the data available for parameter fitting.

  \section EmpiricalDescription Empirical Model Description

   The net photosynthetic rate is described by the equation:

   \f$A = A_{sat} f_L f_T f_C - R_d\f$

   \f$A_{sat}\,({\mu}mol/m^2-s)\f$ is the photosynthesis assimilation rate at saturating irradiance and reference temperature (\f$T_{ref}\f$) and intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (\f$C_{i,ref}\f$).

   \subsection LightResponse Light Response Function

   The response of photosynthesis to light is given by a simple exponential function, which is defined by only one parameter:

   \f$f_L(i) = \dfrac{i}{\theta+i}\f$,

   where \f$\theta\f$ is the light response curvature.

   \subsection TempResponse Temperature Response

   It is assumed that the maximum CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate \f$A_{max}\f$ decreases exponentially about some optimum temperature \f$T_{opt}\f$. The temperature response function is given by:

   \f$f_T(T_s) = \left(\dfrac{T_s-T_{min}}{T_{ref}-T_{min}}\right)^q\left(\dfrac{(1+q)T_{opt}-T_{min}-qT_s}{(1+q)T_{opt}-T_{min}-qT_{ref}}\right)\f$,

   where \f$T_{min}\f$ is the minimum temperature at which assimilation occurs, \f$T_{opt}\f$ is the temperature at which the maximum assimilation rate occurs, \f$T_{ref}\f$ is the reference temperature chosen to define \f$A_{ref}\f$, and \f$q\f$ is a shape parameter.

   The "dark" respiration rate \f$R_d\f$ is assumed to increase exponentially with temperature following the Arrhenius equation (and assumed not to vary with ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration).  Thus, the dark respiration rate is calculated simply as

   \f$R_d = R\sqrt{T_s}\mathrm{exp}\left(-E_R/(T_s+273)\right)\f$,

   where \f$R\f$ and \f$E_R\f$ are parameters, and temperature is in Kelvin.

   \subsection CO2Response CO2 Response Function

   We assume that the maximum assimilation rate varies linearly with intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration over the range of expected concentrations, and is zero at zero CO<sub>2</sub>.  Thus, the response function is simply

   \f$f_C(C_i) = k_C\dfrac{C_i}{C_{i,ref}}\f$,

   where \f$C_i\f$ is intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (\f$\mu\f$mol CO<sub>2</sub>/mol air).

   \subsection Ci Intercellular CO2 Concentration

   The intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is estimated as a function of the boundary-layer conductance, stomatal conductance, and ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration outside of the primitive boundary-layer.  The rate of transport of CO<sub>2</sub> to the leaf (i.e., assimilation rate) is given by

   \f$A = 0.75g_M\left(C_{amb}-C_i\right)\f$,

   where \f$g_M\f$ is the conductance to moisture from the sub-stomatal cells to outside of the boundary-layer. The 0.75 factor comes from the fact that diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> in air is slower than that of water vapor (see Eq. 7.33 of <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387949376#otherversion=9781461216261">Campbell and Norman</a>).

   Since \f$A\f$ is dependent on \f$C_i\f$ and vice-versa, an iterative solution is required for \f$A\f$.

   \subsubsection PhotoLightParam Response of Assimilation Rate to Light

   The response of the assimilation rate to light is obtained from gas exchange measurements at reference temperature (\f$T_{ref}\f$) and CO<sub>2</sub> (\f$C_{i,ref}\f$) in which the irradiance is varied across some range.  However, one important detail is that the dark respiration rate should be removed such that \f$A=0\f$ in the dark (see plot below).  This can be done by measuring the net CO<sub>2</sub> flux starting in the dark, then subtracting the dark flux from the total flux for each subsequent light level.

   \subsubsection PhotoTempParam Response of Assimilation Rate to Temperature

   The response of the assimilation rate to temperature is obtained using gas exchange measurements at saturating light levels and the reference CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.  The temperature is varied across some range, and the assimilation rate is measured.  It is assumed that the optimum temperature \f$T_{opt}\f$ is the temperature corresponding to the maximum measured assimilation rate.  The model is fit to the data to determine \f$T_{min}\f$ and \f$q\f$.

   \subsubsection PhotoRespParam Response of Respiration Rate to Temperature

   The response of the dark respiration to temperature is obtained using gas exchange measurements in the dark.  The leaf is first acclimated to the dark chamber, then leaf temperature is varied across some range.  The model is then fit to the data to determine parameters.

   \subsubsection PhotoCO2Param Response of Assimilation Rate to CO2

   The response of the assimilation rate is obtained using gas exchange measurements at saturating light levels and the reference temperature \f$T_{ref}\f$, but with varying external CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (which produces varying intercellular CO<sub>2</sub>).
