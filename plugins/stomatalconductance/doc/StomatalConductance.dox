  \*\*The stomatal conductance model will also check for primitive data "boundarylayer_conductance_out" if "boundarylayer_conductance" does not exist. If you are using the energy balance model to calculate the boundary-layer conductance, you should enable optional output primitive data "boundarylayer_conductance_out" so that other plug-ins can use it.

 \section StomatalIntro Introduction

 This plugin implements several different stomatal conductance models. A brief description of the theory behind each model is given below, along with coefficients obtained from several example species.

 The default model is the Buckley, Mott, Farquhar model (see \ref BMFTheory).

 \section BWBTheory Ball, Woodrow, Berry (1987) Model Theory

 The <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-0519-6_48">Ball, Woodrow, and Berry (1987)</a> model is based on the empirical observation that stomatal conductance various roughly linearly with the net photosynthetic flux \f$A\f$ and relative humidity at the leaf surface \f$h_s\f$. They proposed the relationship:

 \f[g_s = g_{s,0}+a_1A\beta\frac{h_s}{C_s},\f]

 where \f$C_s\f$ is the air CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at the leaf surface, and \f$g_{s,0}\f$ and \f$a_1\f$ are empirical parameters. \f$\beta\f$ is a factor to account for reduction in stomatal conductance with soil drying and is defined as

 \f[\beta = \frac{\theta-\theta_w}{\theta_f-\theta_w},\f]

 where \f$\theta,\,\theta_f,\,\theta_w\f$ are the effective soil water content, water content at field capacity, and water content at the wilting point. By default, it is assumed that \f$\beta=1\f$.

 This model is at odds with several more recent observation of stomatal function, including: 1) stomata have been shown to respond to the intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration \f$C_i\f$ and not the concentration outside of the leaf <a href="https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/86/1/200/6082897">(Mott 1988)</a>; 2) stomata respond to the rate of evaporation, not humidity itself <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1991.tb01521.x?casa_token=FVBmxdVmcYgAAAAA:FKEQjeKvXUSfz2fWQRhMmpi-7TiT8WTPz1pAE6U-PV92CaHLPATox31guMa_bd2ecd_EqwC1XYW-AdhE">(Mott and Parkhurst 1991)</a>; 3) the predicted \f$g_s\f$ value could become negative; 4) the predicted value of \f$g_s\f$ approaches infinity as \f$C_s\rightarrow \infty\f$; 5) the predicted value of \f$g_s\f$ does not respond to soil drying. Another more practical limitation is that photosynthesis must also be modeled in order to calculate stomatal conductance. Nonetheless, this model is one of the most commonly used models of stomatal conductance.

 The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at the leaf surface is calculated as

 \f[C_s = C_a-\frac{A}{0.75g_{bw}},\f]

 where \f$0.75g_{bw}\f$ is the boundary-layer conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> (assuming the diffusivity of CO<sub>2</sub> in air is 0.75 that of water vapor), and \f$C_a\f$ is the air CO<sub>2</sub> concentration outside of the leaf boundary-layer.

 The relative humidity at the leaf surface is calculated by setting up a water vapor flux balance at the leaf surface and iteratively solving for the humidity at the leaf surface:

 \f[g_s*e_{sat}(T_L)*(1-h_s) = g_{bw}*(e_{sat}(T_L)h_s-e_{sat}(T_a)h_a),\f]

 where \f$e_{sat}(T_L)\f$ and \f$e_{sat}(T_a)\f$ are the saturated vapor pressure evaluated respectively at the leaf surface and air temperature (calculated according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetens_equation">Tetens equation</a>), and \f$h_a\f$ is the air relative humidity outside the leaf boundary-layer.

 Below are example parameter values for several different tree crop species (a description of how calibration data was collected is given in the section below). Note that, as mentioned above, in order to apply the model photosynthesis must also be modeled - coefficients for these species are also given in the photosynthesis model documentation.

\section BBLTheory Ball-Berry-Leuning Model Theory

<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-0519-6_48">Leuning et al. (1990,1995)</a> revised the original Ball, Woodrow, Berry model to overcome some of it's original limitations, namely the fact that \f$g_s\f$ approaches infinity as \f$C_s\rightarrow \infty\f$ by calculating stomatal conductance as

\f[g_s = g_{s,0}+\frac{a_1A\beta}{\left(C_s-\Gamma\right)\left(1+\frac{D_s}{D_0}\right)},\f]

where \f$D_s\f$ is the vapor pressure deficit between the sub-stomatal cavity and the leaf surface, \f$\Gamma\f$ is the CO<sub>2</sub> compensation point of photosynthesis (including dark respiration), and \f$D_0\f$ (mmol/mol) is an additional empirical parameter.

\f$D_s\f$ is calculated by first determining the surface relative humidity as described above for the Ball, Woodrow, Berry model, then calculating the surface vapor pressure deficit as \f$D_s=\frac{e_{sat}(T_L)(1-h_s)}{p_{atm}}\f$ (\f$p_{atm}\f$ is atmospheric pressure).

Below are example parameter values for several different tree crop species (a description of how calibration data was collected is given in the section below). Note that, as mentioned above, in order to apply the model photosynthesis must also be modeled - coefficients for these species are also given in the photosynthesis model documentation.

\section MoptTheory Medlyn et al. (2011) Optimality-Based Model

The stomatal conductance mode of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02375.x">Medlyn et al. (2011)</a> combines the empirical modeling approach with the hypothesis that stomata should act should act to optimally minimize the amount of water used per unit carbon gained.

\f[g_s = g_{s,0}+1.6\left(1+\frac{g_1\sqrt{\beta}}{\sqrt{D_s P_{atm}}}\right)\frac{A}{C_s},\f]

where \f$D_s\f$ is in units of mol/mol, and \f$P_{atm}\f$ is atmospheric pressure in kPa. Note that there are a couple of deviations of this equation from that presented in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02375.x">Medlyn et al. (2011)</a>: 1) The factor of 1.6 is needed for the resulting conductance to be that of water vapor, 2) We express \f$D_s\f$ in units of mol/mol, and thus multiplication by the atmospheric pressure is needed to get units of kPa, 3) We use surface values for VPD and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, which allows for incorporation of boundary-layer effects.

One issue with this model is that stomatal conductance blows up to infinity as \f$D_s\rightarrow 0\f$. Our implementation imposes an arbitrary minimum \f$D_s\f$ value of 0.00001 mol/mol.

Below are example parameter values for several different tree crop species (a description of how calibration data was collected is given in the section below). Note that, as mentioned above, in order to apply the model photosynthesis must also be modeled - coefficients for these species are also given in the photosynthesis model documentation.

\section BMFTheory Buckley, Mott, Farquhar (2003) Model (simplified version given in Buckley, Turnbull, and Adams 2012)

The stomatal conductance model of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2012.02515.x/full">Buckley, Turnbull, and Adams (2012)</a> is a simplification of the hydromechanical/biochemical model orignially proposed by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2003.01094.x">Buckley, Mott, and Farquhar (2003)</a>. The original model is highly complex with many parameters, but with the simplifications described by Buckley, Turnbull, and Adams (2003), an explicit expression for stomatal conductance can be written as

\f[g_s = \frac{E_m\beta(Q+i_0)}{k+bQ+(Q+i_0)D_s},\f]

where \f$Q\f$ is the photosynthetic photon flux density, \f$D_s\f$ is defined and calculated as described for other models above, \f$E_m,\,i_0,\,k,\f$ and \f$b\f$ are semi-empirical parameters. Note that the photosynthetic flux that is input to the plug-in is in units of energy flux (W/m<sup>2</sup>), but \f$Q\f$ in this equation is photon flux density (\f$\mu\f$mol/m<sup>2</sup>-s). This is because the primitive data value output from the radiation model is in energy flux. The stomatal conductance plug-in automatically converts energy flux to photon flux density using a factor of <a href="https://www.controlledenvironments.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/06/Ch01.pdf">4.57 \f$\mu\f$mol/W</a>.

\section StomatalUse Using the Stomatal Conductance Model

\subsection StomatalCoeffs Setting the Model Coefficients

Each model has a data structure containing member variables for each of the model parameters. These are listed in the table below.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Model</th>
        <th>Parameter Structure</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ball, Woodrow, Berry</td>
        <td>\ref BWBcoefficients "BWBcoefficients"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ball, Berry, Leuning</td>
        <td>\ref BBLcoefficients "BBLcoefficients"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Medlyn et al. Optimality</td>
        <td>\ref MOPTcoefficients "MOPTcoefficients"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Buckley, Mott, Farquhar</td>
        <td>\ref BMFcoefficients "BMFcoefficients"</td>
    </tr>
</table>

In order to modify model coefficients from the default values, one should 1) declare and instance of the coefficient structure, 2) modify the appropriate data elements of the data structure, and 3) pass the data structure to the \ref StomatalConductanceModel::setModelCoefficients() function. Model coefficients can be set to the same value for all primitives, or differently for a subset of primitives based on a vector of UUIDs. Example code is given below

<p> <br> </p>

```
 BMFcoefficients modelcoeffs;
 modelcoeffs.Em = 9.3;
 modelcoeffs.i0 = 5.3;
 modelcoeffs.k = 672;
 modelcoeffs.b = 6.7;
```

\subsection StomatalRun Running the Model (steady-state mode)

There are two possible functions to run the model: one to run the model for all primitives in the Context (see \ref StomatalConductanceModel::run "run()"), and another to run the model only for a subset of primitives given their UUIDs (see \ref StomatalConductanceModel::run "run()").

  ```
  #include "StomatalConductanceModel.h"

  using namespace helios;

  int main(){

     //Initialize the Context and add some geometry
     Context context;

     context.addPatch( make_vec3(0,0,0), make_vec2(1,1) );

     //Initialize the stomatal conductance model
     StomatalConductanceModel stomatalmodel( &context );

     //Initialize model coefficients and modify their values
     BMFcoefficients modelcoeffs;  //values are initialized with default values
     modelcoeffs.Em = 9.3;  //we can modify one or more parameters
     modelcoeffs.i0 = 5.3;
     modelcoeffs.k = 672;
     modelcoeffs.b = 6.7;

     stomatalmodel.setModelCoefficients( modelcoeffs );

     //-- Normally you would initialize and run some other models (e.g., radiation, energybalance) here --//

     //Run the stomatal conductance model (for all primitives)
     stomatalmodel.run();

  }
  ```

  \subsection StomatalRunDyn Running the Model in Dynamic Mode

  Any of the above steady-state models can be run in dynamic mode by specifying a timestep and response time constants, which will delay stomatal response to environmental stimuli. When environmental conditions are changed, the stomatal conductance will exponentially relax toward the steady-state value, which is calculated according to any of the above models.

  Let the steady-state stomatal conductance value calculated according to any of the above models be denoted by \f$g_{s,ss}\f$. Then the dynamic stomatal conductance is calculated according to the following equation

  \f[\dfrac{d g_s}{dt} = \dfrac{g_{s,ss} - g_s}{\tau},\f]

  where

  \f$\tau\f$ is the time constant for stomatal response to a change in environmental conditions, and \f$\tau = \tau_{open}\f$ if stomata are opening, and \f$\tau = \tau_{close}\f$ if stomata are closing.

  The above equation can be discretized using a forward Euler scheme to update the stomatal conductance after each timestep \f$\Delta t\f$ as

  \f[g_s^{new} = g_s^{old} + \dfrac{g_{s,ss} - g_s^{old}}{\tau}\Delta t.\f]

  The response time constants \f$\tau_{open}\f$ and \f$\tau_{close}\f$ are specified using the \ref StomatalConductanceModel::setDynamicTimeConstants() method. If time constants are not defined, a warning will be issued and the model will run in steady-state mode.

  The model also requires an initial stomatal conductance value, which is specified by setting primitive data "moisture_conductance". If this primitive data is not defined, the model will run in steady-state mode for the first timestep, and this steady-state value will become the initial value for running in dynamic mode.

  Below is and example of running the model in dynamic mode.

  ```
  #include "StomatalConductanceModel.h"

  using namespace helios;

  int main(){

    //Initialize the Context and add some geometry
    Context context;

    uint UUID = context.addPatch();

    //Initialize the stomatal conductance model
    StomatalConductanceModel stomatalmodel( &context );

    //Initialize model coefficients with default values
    BMFcoefficients modelcoeffs;  //values are initialized with default values
    stomatalmodel.setModelCoefficients( modelcoeffs );

    //Set the response time constants (seconds)
    float tau_open = 10;
    float tau_close = 10;
    stomatalmodel.setDynamicTimeConstants(tau_open, tau_close);

    //Set the initial stomatal conductance value
    float gs_initial = 0.2f;
    context.setPrimitiveData( UUID, "moisture_conductance", gs_initial );

    float dt = 1; //timestep (seconds)
    int Nsteps = 50; //number of timesteps to run

    for( int t=0; t<Nsteps; t++ ){

        //Run the model for each timestep
        stomatalmodel.run(dt);

        //Get and print the stomatal conductance value
        float gs_dyn;
        context.getPrimitiveData( UUID, "moisture_conductance", gs_dyn );
        std::cout << "Timestep " << t << ": " << gs_dyn << std::endl;

    }

  }
 ```
